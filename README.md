Ongoing AI-based project.

# Introduction
This model assumes that general sammers quite often resort to a few third-party text generators, since many of them pay so little attention to schools. Among the fraudulent texts, some specific patterns are always present. In this project, the AI model stemmed from Scikit-learn considers the patterns as the texts' fingerprints. As every fingerprint has features, such as "COUNTRY," "MONETARY," "JOB_RELATED," etc., a fingerprint contributes a vector in a training set or a test set.
